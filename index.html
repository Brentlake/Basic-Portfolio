		<p id="p1">Hi, my name is Brent Lake and I am 25 years old. I am a California boy who lives in Austin, Texas and I love it here! I went to high school in Mission Viejo, California and went to college at Califonia State University of San Marcos but after my third year I decided to take a break. A little over three years ago I was given an opportunity to move out to Austin and I thought why not try some place new!   
		<br>
		I was planning of finishing school out here but three weeks after I moved here I shattered my skull skateboarding and had to have brain surgery. Through recovery I began to look at life in a different way and realize I am not indestructable and it has really made me focus on whats important in life. It was the best worst thing that has happened to me.</p>
